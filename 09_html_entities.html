    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>

    <p>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard. - Source <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity">MDN Web Docs</a></p>
